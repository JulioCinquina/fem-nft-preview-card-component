## My process

### What I learned

In this project, I have practiced the following skills:

- Creating a responsive component with **semantic HTML**, **CSS** and **JavaScript**
- Using the **`<dialog>` element** and **JavaScript** to create a modal
- **Styling scrollbars** in Firefox, Chrome and Safari
- Detecting if a device supports hovering with the `@media (hover: hover)` media query
- Using **CSS relative units** to ensure the page scales according to the user's font size settings
- Using **CSS custom properties** to allow easy customization and reusability of components
- Using **Git** and **GitHub**

### Continued development

To further develop this project, I would like to use a polyfill to ensure a great experience for older browsers that might not support the `<dialog>` element. As of September 27, 2022, [the `<dialog>` element is supported by 92.18% of browsers in use globally](https://caniuse.com/dialog).
